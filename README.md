# Image2Text
A user-friendly GUI application that uses OCR technology to extract text from images.

## Purpose
Image2Text is a tool for converting image files to text, utilizing the Tesseract OCR engine. The goal is to provide a fast and easy-to-use solution for extracting text from images.

## Background
After using several various image to text tools on the internet, I got tired of waiting for slow converting times and limited conversions. I decided to create a new tool that is fast, efficient, local, and provides more control over the conversion process.

## Current Features
- Easy to use interface
- Supports multiple image file formats (png, xpm, jpg, bmp, gif)
- Fast image to text conversion powered by the Tesseract OCR engine
- Preview of the image before conversion
- Output displayed in a text box

## Future Features
- Option to save output to a text file
- Support for additional image file formats

## How to Use
1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Install the required dependencies (PyQt5, PIL, pytesseract).
3) Run the main script main.py to start the application.
4) Select an image file to convert using the "Open Image" button.
5) Click the "Convert" button to convert the image to text using the tesseract OCR engine.
6) The extracted text will be displayed in the text box.
